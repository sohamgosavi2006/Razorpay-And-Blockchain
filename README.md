# 🔗 Razorpay & Blockchain Payment Integration

## 🚀 Introduction
This project bridges the gap between **fiat and cryptocurrency payments**, offering a seamless experience for both users and businesses. By integrating **Razorpay** for INR transactions and **Web3** for Sepolia ETH payments, it ensures fast, secure, and transparent financial transactions. Users can handle gas fees via **MetaMask**, track wallet balances, and log transactions efficiently. Whether you're dealing with traditional payments or diving into the world of Web3, this project makes digital transactions effortless.

## 🔥 Features
- **Fiat Payments:** Secure INR transactions using Razorpay.
- **Blockchain Transactions:** Send and receive Sepolia ETH via Web3.
- **Gas Fee Handling:** MetaMask automatically manages gas payments for Sepolia ETH transactions.
- **Wallet Tracking:** View available INR & ETH balance in real time.
- **Transaction History:** Displays past transactions along with transaction hashes (Tx IDs).
- **MetaMask Integration:** Seamless connection to a Web3 wallet for authentication and payments.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Razorpay API** – Handles fiat transactions.
- **Web3.js** – Connects to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask** – Manages Sepolia ETH transactions & gas fees.
- **Bootstrap** – Provides a responsive UI.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** – Core frontend technologies.

## 📌 How Gas Works in This Project
1. **Transaction Execution:** When sending Sepolia ETH, the transaction requires gas.
2. **Gas Calculation:** MetaMask estimates gas usage based on network activity.
3. **Gas Payment:** The gas fee is deducted from the sender’s Sepolia ETH balance.
4. **Tx Confirmation:** Once the transaction is validated, the Tx ID is recorded.

## 🌐 Understanding Web3, Sepolia ETH Gas Fees, MetaMask, and Razorpay
### **Web3**
Web3 represents the next generation of the internet, enabling **decentralized applications (dApps)** that interact directly with blockchain networks like Ethereum.

### **Sepolia ETH & Gas Fees**
- Sepolia is an Ethereum **testnet**, used for testing smart contracts and transactions.
- **Gas fees** are required to process transactions, paid in **Sepolia ETH**.
- The cost is determined by the complexity of the transaction and network congestion.

### **MetaMask**
- A Web3 **crypto wallet & gateway**, allowing users to send, receive, and manage ETH.
- Handles **gas fees** automatically for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Provides **secure authentication** for dApps and Web3 projects.

### **Razorpay**
- A leading payment gateway for **INR transactions** in India.
- Supports UPI, credit/debit cards, and net banking.
- Integrates easily with web applications to process fiat payments securely.

### **Transaction Log**
- Each transaction (fiat or crypto) generates a **Transaction ID (Tx ID)**.
- This ID is stored in the **transaction history log** for tracking and verification.
